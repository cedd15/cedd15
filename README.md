Hi, I'm Cedd from Manila, Philippines.

I'm a .Net developer since April 2022 and currently learning front-end development with React 
to become a full-stack dev.

My current skills are:

C#
ASP.NET Web API
SQL Server
Azure DevOps

If you need  a .Net dev for your company or for an open source project, I'm happy to contribute.
